# Gumstix-Yocto-101

The Gusmtix Overo and Duovero boards come by defautl with the Yocto system installaed (https://www.yoctoproject.org/). The gumstix packages for the Yocto project can be found in https://packages.gumstix.com/

I have prepared a ”[Yocto Quick Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TbABqi4KHAE674gUkDSgM7bA1ZVFMc1fjFgu1kjtkyY/edit?usp=sharing)” to help students get started on gumstix with Yocto installed.
